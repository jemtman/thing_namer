Requires package: markovify

This is a little project that I've put together for the supports of Here Be Monsters podcast (https://HBMpodcast.com) on Patreon. 

Takes an input text file with words on each line, and turns them into new words which are different from the inputs, but still in the same style.  So, it's good for naming things....plants, babies, dogs, etc. 

Example outputs (using baby name data set) : 
- Jortus
- Grr
- Shert
- Dord
- Hougus

Several variables are available to change in the .py file, located near the top. 

Please note: This code could generate some offensive outputs.  It didn't ever happen in any of my testing with the default text file.  But, it is technically possible, though unlikely. 

Hope you get some nice results and let me know if you use this code to name your kid etc. :)
