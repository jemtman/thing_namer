######################## IMPORTS #######################

# markovify lets us make the new names. 
import markovify
#if you don't have it, run "pip install markovify" on your command line. 

# time package is needed for pauses
import time

######################## USER VARIABLES #######################
#  - Change these variables as you see fit

# How many results to deliver with each run.
number_of_names = 5

# This is the state size of the markov model.  1 will yield the most wild results.
# For short things like names, I wouldn't recommend anything higher than 3.  2 is default.
normalness = 2

# Max number of characters in any given result. 
max_name_length = 15

# A text file where each entry is on a new line.  Used to train markov model.
raw_text = "baby_names.txt"


######################## FUNCTIONS #######################
# sillyPrint lets output print slowly for dramatic effect.  Used heavily throughout program.

Thing Namer is a tool for naming things.  It uses a text file to train a 
simple Markov model that can generate new names. It comes with a list of 
baby names from the United States from the last hundred-ish years. You can
alter the code to have it generate from anything you'd like though. 

NOTE: This program needs "Markovify" to run: https://pypi.org/project/markovify/
